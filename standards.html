                            <p>Every product that we put on our shelves goes through a strict process, to ensure that it meets our high quality standards.  These process are:</p>
                            <h4>Identifying the Source:</h4> <p>our sources are companies whose values and reputation are in line with our own.</p>
                            <h4>Analyzing the Ingredients:</h4> <p>There is a long list of ingredients that have been completely banned from being in any of the products we carry in our market including any GMO products. </p>
                            <h4>Meeting Our Standards:</h4><p> Every product we carry must meet our high quality standards in order to be stocked on our store. These standards differ depending on the type of product, but generally, we are looking for natural , organic, and environmentally sound products.</p>
                            <h2>Customer Empowerment</h2>
                            <p>As a health conscious consumer, you like to stay up-to-date with your dietary supplement and body care product information, making sure you're aware of any potential purchasing risks that may impact you.

                            <h2>Non-GMO</h2>
                            <p>A GMO, or genetically modified organism, is a plant, animal, microorganism or other organism whose genetic makeup has been modified using recombinant DNA methods (also called gene splicing), gene modification or transgenic technology. This relatively new science creates unstable combinations of plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional crossbreeding methods. 
                             We are proud members of the Non-GMO Project, a non-profit multi-stakeholder collaboration committed to preserving and building sources of non-GMO products, educating consumers, and providing verified non-GMO choices. </p>
