                                <p>About six years ago the owners of the small business "The Real Way", Binyam and Sewi, welcomed their first child Nathan, a very happy and energetic child. As any healthy child Nathan had been feeding on his mother's milk.  Yet, when he was about to  turn one year old he started to show an unusual reaction on his body. After a number of follow ups and checkups his pediatrician said it might be the diary products that his mom is drinking that created this reactions.  Yes, he was allergic to all dairy products and also to egg. The only option in order to replace the important nutrients that he  is missing was through nature itself, increasing the amount of vegetables and  fruits, strictly non-GMO organic products. Now, not only he grew out of the allergy but also all the nutrients he has are of the required level.</p>
                                <p>Inspired by this (in order to share the benefits of pure nature) and using her background in Agriculture, Sewi created the idea of the small business The Real Way. The focus of the business is not only natural and real food based dietary supplement for a healthy living but it is also to promote natural products with no added synthetic materials in the food we take as well as in the products we put on our body. </p><br><br>
